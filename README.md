Observable Trends:

1.  Most of the player base are adults between the ages of 20 and 24 years old, representing 258 players or 44.79% of the player base.  Furthermore, most of the player base identifies as male, accounting for 484 of the 576 players or 84.03% of the player base.  The data appears to be right skewed with the majority of the players being in two age groups: 15 to 19 and 20 to 24.

2.  As expected due to males comprising most of the player base; male players account for most in-game transactions and spend the most by volume at $1,967.64.  However, male players spend the least per person averaging $3.02 per purchase, and $4.07 per player.

3. The age groups that spend the most per purchases are those between the ages of 35 to 39 who spend $3.60 on average, and <10 who spend $3.35 on average.  One could speculate that this phenomenon is caused by the fact that those between the ages of 35 to 39 typically have a steady job/career allowing them to spend extra cash on luxury goods like a video games.  This same theory applies to those under <10, as they have no dependents/liabilities and are able to spend without considering the opportunity cost of the transaction.
